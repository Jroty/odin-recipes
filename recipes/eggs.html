    <h1>Boursin Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>These are some great eggs to try at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons half-and-half</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic and fine herbs, spreadable cheese (such as Boursin), cold and crumbled</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>chopped fresh parsley or chives, for garnish</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, half-and-half, and a pinch of salt together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium nonstick pan over medium-low heat. When butter starts to bubble, pour in egg mixture. Using a silicone spatula, gently swirl the eggs around in circles from the outside in, without stopping, until you start to see small curds, about 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Switch from making circles to making long sweeps across the pan until you see larger curds, about 20 seconds. When eggs are about 75% cooked, gently fold in cheese. The eggs now should be softly set and still a little runny in places.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat, and set aside for about 20 to 35 seconds to allow the residual heat to finish cooking to your preferred consistency.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley or chives, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
